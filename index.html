Moreover, Mosquitoes kill 2,740 people every day, HUMANS kill 1,300 fellow humans every day, and Snakes kill 137 people every day.</p>

               <p  class="article-body">Syria's dictator name is Assad. Letter A is added as a prefix to make it Fassad which stands for corruption.
               This monster has ben presenting himself as apieceful lamb, while in truth, he has killed more than a million and forcd more than 2 thirds of the population to migrate either within Syria or outside accross the world.
               If it’s not happening in your country That doesn't mean it’s not happening. Think about Syria. the hard fact with this virus is that you cannot self-isolate or stay in home. if you do, your roof will get bombarded and fall on you and your family.</p>

               <p  class="article-body">Putin, the killer. I named him the devil octobus because he is like an octobus with many tentacles and arms killing and bombarding civilians and innocent people defying his policies supporting dictators in Syria, Libya, Ukraine, and many other places around the world.
               The hard fact about this virus is that you could be taken to Siberia so their scientists use you devily in their expeiments. Otherwise, your roof will get bombarded and fall on you and your family if you oppose his ally dictators.</p>
